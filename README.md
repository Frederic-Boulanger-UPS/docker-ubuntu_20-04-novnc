docker-ubuntu_22-04-novnc
===================

This was a Docker image to provide HTML5 VNC interface to access a Ubuntu 22.04 LXDE desktop environment.
It is now **obsolete**, **no longer maintained**, and has **many security holes**.

The Zip file is here only for people who relied on this project.

I now rely on webtop images from [https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-webtop/](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-webtop/)
